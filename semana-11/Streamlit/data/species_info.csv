Laminaria digitata,"A large conspicuous kelp growing up to 2 m in length commonly found at low water during spring tides on rocky shores. The frond is broad and digitate, glossy and dark brown in colour and lacks a midrib. The stipe is oval in cross section, smooth and flexible and is usually free of epiphytes, although old stipes which have become slightly roughened may support a few epiphytes, notably Palmaria palmata. The kelp is attached by freely branched haptera, which spread out to form a shallow dome-shaped holdfast. Laminaria digitata may be confused with young Laminaria hyperborea plants. However, the stipe of Laminaria hyperborea is circular in cross section, is stiff and snaps easily when bent (although you won't see that in younger plants)."," Frond is broad, leathery and digitate. Lacks a midrib. Stipe is flexible and smooth, oval in cross section and free of epiphytes except maybe Palmaria palmata in older kelps. Holdfast of freely branched haptera which spread out to form a shallow dome. May be confused with young Laminaria hyperborea plants. However, the stipe of Laminaria hyperborea is circular in cross section and stiff.","Global distribution
Recorded from the Atlantic coasts of Europe as far north as Novaya Zemlya and south to the Canary Islands including the Baltic and Black Sea. It has also been recorded in Romania. (Information continued in additional information)."
Laminaria hyperborea,"A large conspicuous kelp which can grow up to 3.5 m in length in suitable conditions although this length is rarely attained (J. Jones, pers. comm.). The blade is broad, large, tough, flat and divided into 5 - 20 straps or fingers (digitate). The blade is glossy, golden brown to very dark brown in colour. The holdfast is large, conical and branched with conspicuous haptera. The stipe is stiff, rough textured, thick at the base and tapers towards the frond. The stipe stands erect when out of water. The stipe is often covered with numerous epifauna and epiflora. The amount of energy allocated to growth of the stipe, and consequently maximum length of stipe, varies with season, the age of plant and location. This species is often confused with Laminaria digitata, especially when young."," Large frond up to 1 m in length lacking midrib. Frond is smooth, wide and digitate. Stipe stiff, rough in texture and often covered by red seaweeds. Stipe is circular in cross section and snaps when bent if already nicked. May be confused with Laminaria digitata when young. However, the stipe of Laminaria digitata is usually oval in cross section, not thicker at the base and does not snap easily.","Global distribution
Restricted to the north east Atlantic from the northern coast of Iceland, north to the Russian coast near Murmansk and south to Cape Mondego, mid-Portugal including Norway, Faroes, northern France and northern Spain but absent from the Bay of Biscay."
Halidrys siliquosa,"A large sturdy brown alga 0.3 -1 m in length (occasionally up to 2 m) rising from a strong, flattened cone shaped holdfast. The main stem is flattened and branches alternately to give a distinctly zigzag appearance. The stem bears a few, flattened ribbon-like 'leafy' fronds. The ends of some branches bear characteristic pod-shaped air bladders (about 0.5 cm wide by 1-4 cm long) that are divided by transverse septa into 10 or 12 compartments. The branches also bear reproductive bodies that appear similar to the bladders but lack the septa. Young plants are olive-green in colour while older specimens are dark brown and leathery. This species is perennial."," Flattened cone shaped holdfast. Regularly alternately branched. Main stem 'zigzag' in appearance. Presence of terminal pod-shaped air bladders, resembling seed pods, divided by septa into 10 or 12 compartments.","Global distribution
Restricted to the north east Atlantic, and recorded from northern Norway, Scandinavia, the Baltic Sea, Helgoland and the Netherlands south to the Bay of Biscay, north Portugal and the Canary Islands (John et al., 2004)."
Palmaria palmata,"A foliose red algae with a tough flat frond usually between 20 and 50 cm in length, but sometimes up to 1m. The algae grows directly from a small discoid holdfast gradually widening and subdividing. The stipe is inconspicuous, rarely to 5 mm long. Older parts may have small 'leaflets' along the margin especially where damaged. Dark red, with purple tints under water."," Blade leathery-membranous without midrib, the total length usually between 20 cm and 50c m long, but sometimes up to 1 m. Blade width about 3-8 cm rarely up to 16 cm. Fronds solitary or a few together, simple below or branching from the base, stipe inconspicuous, blade gradually expanding above, dichotomously or palmately divided into broad segments. Blade sometimes simple, with marginal proliferations often dichotomous and large, resembling primary blade. Thallus with a discoid holdfast and erect fronds, purplish red in colour.","Global distribution
Arctic Russia to Portugal; Baltic. Artic Canada to USA (New Jersey); USA (Alaska to California); Japan, Korea."
Fucus serratus,"Fucus serratus, the toothed wrack, is a robust, olive-brown shrubby seaweed that grows in high densities low on the seashore. The fronds are about 2 cm wide, splitting in two repeatedly. The fronds bear no air bladders. The whole plant typically grows to about 60 cm long. The fronds have a serrated edge and grow from a short stalk."," Fronds are flat and straplike with a well developed mid-rib. Fronds edged with sharp, forward-pointing serrations. The frond bears no air bladders. The frond surface has numerous pin-pricks with clusters of tiny white hairs. Receptacles form slightly thickened patches about 4 cm long surrounded by a sterile border at the terminal end of the frond.","Global distribution
Northern Portugal and the Atlantic coast of France; British Isles, North Sea coasts and into the western Baltic; Scandinavia up to Novaya Zemlya; Iceland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the western north Atlantic."
Ascophyllum nodosum,"A common large brown seaweed, dominant on sheltered rocky shores. The species has long strap like fronds with large egg-shaped air bladders at regular intervals. The fronds of Ascophyllum nodosum are typically between 0.5 and 2m in length. The species often bears tufts of the small reddish-brown filamentous epiphytic algae Polysiphonia lanosa. Ascophyllum nodosum occurs on the middle of the shore, often with Fucus vesiculosus. The species grows slowly and plants can live to be several decades old. Individual fronds can become up to 15 years old before breakage.", Frond narrow without midrib. Large swollen egg shaped air bladders at intervals along middle of the frond. Reproductive bodies rounded on short stalks. Dichotomously branched.,"Global distribution
Global distribution is restricted to the North Atlantic Ocean. Its northern limits are the White Sea in the east and Baffin Island in the west. Southern distributions extend to northern Portugal and New Jersey."
Chondrus crispus,"Chondrus crispus is a small purplish-red seaweed (up to 22 cm long) found on rocky shores and in pools. The fronds grow dichotomously from a narrow, unbranched stipe and are flat and wide with rounded tips. This seaweed is highly variable in appearance depending on the level of wave exposure of the shore and has a tendency to turn green in strong sunlight. Underwater, the tips of the frond can be iridescent."," Thallus with discoid holdfast and erect fronds arising in tufts. Un-branched stipe gradually expanding into fan-like blade. Fronds repeatedly dichotomous (up to 5 times) with rounded axils, usually expanding but occasionally tapering towards rounded apices. Female fruiting bodies (carposporangia) occur terminally in cystocarps that protrude strongly as concave-convex swellings 2 mm in diameter. Form highly variable depending on environment.","Global distribution

Fucus vesiculosus,"The bladder wrack Fucus vesiculosus is a large brown algae, common on the middle shore. It can be found in high densities living for about 4-5 years (S. Kraan, pers. comm.). Under sheltered conditions, the fronds have been known to grow up to 2 m in Maine, America (Wippelhauser, 1996)."," Frond with prominent midrib and almost spherical air bladders. Air bladders usually paired but may be absent in very small plants. Margin of frond smooth. Dichotomously branched. The species may be confused with Fucus spiralis with which it hybridizes. A bladderless form occurs on more wave exposed shores (S. Kraan, pers. comm.).","Global distribution
