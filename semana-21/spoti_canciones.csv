The dollar buys a nickel's worth; banks are going bust; shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter; punks are running wild in the street, and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to itWe know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat. And we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be! We know things are bad - worse than bad - they're crazy. It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out any more. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, ""Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials, and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.""Well, I'm not going to leave you aloneI want you to get mad!I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to riot. I don't want you to write to your Congressman, because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first, you've got to get mad. You've gotta say, ""I'm a human being, goddammit! My life has value!""So, I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!"""

de ""Urbanología""][Intro: Nach]La ciencia de ahí fueraCuando no sepas qué decir, yo lo diré por tiUrbanología, la calle y sus destellosVidas con la soga al cuello, y es que...[Verso 1: Nach]No hay nada que entender, mucho que sentirNada que perder, mucho por vivir, lucho por seguirPor servir de algo, dejé atrás largos letargosY tragos amargos, hoy cabalgo a salvoDel dardo que lanza el paso del tiempoLo hago a mi modoEscarbo en estiércol y extraigo oroBusco la belleza en el cementoSiempre hay una historia que contarSiempre hay un anhelo y un lamentoUn aumento del volumenHará que suene más alto, pero no más claroNo enmascaro que temo al disparo y su sonido secoQue intento no gritarMás que por el ruido, por el miedo al ecoSólo soy un tipo tímido, no me hago el suecoMe llaman suicida por salvar mi vida sin chalecoPor lanzarme al vacío, desde que era críoSupe que lo mío era el tacto frío de un cuaderno huecoSi peco de ingenuo es por buscar quimerasSentaré cuerpo y cabeza cuando mueraY es que ahí fuera hay tanto tinteTanto tonto que aparenta ser perfectoTantos que fingen y atentan contra mi intelectoEs la causa-efecto cuando el falso afecto inunda el aireAhora sé que cuando nadie te odia es porque no eres nadie¿Lo pillas acaso?Sé que hay millones de mirones que vigilan cada pasoTodo el mundo habla, todo el mundo juzgaPero después todos se cagan cuando vienen curvasQuieren la pulpa pero tragan cáscarasLa verdad se nubla cuando llueven máscarasCuando hasta las certezas se derrumbanDime ¿qué te queda?Si tras la penumbra te espera la tumba, es normal que te hundasPero cuando caigas hondo, convéncete al momentoQue hay cárceles que creas tú y te metes dentro¿Quieres encontrarme?Estaré en el fondo del bar, siempre sedientoQueriendo responder tantas preguntas que parecen mudasPero saco un disco nuevo y de repente se acaban todas las dudasY es que le pongo amor hasta cuando escribo de odioTengo el honor de hablarle al folio y a medio hemisferioY aunque no sé dónde voy, sé que siempre hay un destino en serioPara algunos la cárcel o el cementerioYo tuve suerte, sé de dónde vengoYa me hice un nombreAhora lo mantengo, dicen que me vendoIdiotas hablan pero se esfuman temprano, sus carrerasDuran lo que a mí me dura un grano, me da igual si os ganoNo me lo planteo, me centro en lo belloSoy quien más podría fardar y quien menos habla de elloUrbanología, la calle y sus destellosY el hip hop mostrando tronos a los parias y plebeyosAquellos pocos que siguieron su propia sendaEsos locos de ayer que hoy son leyendasTodos buscamos a tientas sitio donde el miedo duermaPorque todo se reduce a nuestro miedo a sufrirTodos buscamos un Dios, un más allá, una vida eternaPorque todo se reduce a nuestro miedo a morirSólo queda sobrevivir, ése es mi leitmotivCuando no sepas qué decir yo lo diré por tiMe llevaré el botín y no hablo de bolsillos llenosAunque si roba el de arriba, el de abajo no va a hacer menosEs lo que tenemos, demasiado circo y poco panDemasiados chicos caen como en un tobogánSorbos que se dan saben a venenoRemos que no saben dónde van, no verán horizontes nuevosYo me muevo ajeno al ego, me entrego a mi libertadNo es un juego, tengo fieras que hay que alimentarY es elemental fluir como todos los ríos, por todos los míosSon tantos los líos y los desencantosPero ante el frío mis homies hacen de mantoY no hay Grammy's que superen el amor que me dais tantosOtros criticando en su computer, los pongo en muteLes apago el router, cutres discuten sin que me inmuteNo me repercuten tira'eras quinceañerasNi peleas entre la vieja y la nueva, no se enteranQue quien más calla a veces es el que más sabeY que quien menos vacila es el que más se saleMás les vale madurar o no van a durar ni un cuartoCreen que triunfar en el rap se puede lograr de un saltoLos aparto con mi eclipseEl éxito no me excitó, mi léxico tardó décadas en pulirseUn curro que no acepta erratas ni despistesNi chistes que al ver pasta no dudan en desvestirse[Interludio]""La vida es como una tela bordadaNos pasamos la primera parte de la vidaEn el lado bonito del bordadoPero la segunda parte de nuestra vidaLa pasamos en el otro ladoEs menos bonito, pero vemos cómo están dispuestos los hilos""[Verso 2: Nach]Vivo atrapado en un reloj de arenaConfiar en la bondad ajena me empujó al desprecioPor culpa de la impotenciaNecios que sentencian no son un problemaEl problema es el silencio si almacena indiferenciaYa mi inocencia la perdí en algún despisteHoy el niño que un día fui me habla, mientras insisteEn que disfrute del trayecto, dice que nada es perfectoQue o me divierto o soy hombre muerto, y morir es tristeLa vida un chiste o una putada, no séSólo sé que no creo en nada y nada calma mi sedTantas horas que pasé escribiendo estoNo es un pretexto, sabes que mis textos son mi forma de serSigo mirando al papel como quien mira a la chica más lindaCojo el trozo de pastel que trae la guindaPruébala te sabrá a tinta, la que derramoAsí sostengo en las manos penas y conquistasMis fraseos son como paseos por la tundraAbundan fariseos con deseos de que me hundaYo usando la zurda de Picasso pintando fracasosBebiendo fe como si alguien me quitara el vasoDando pasos en la escalinataMatando el tiempo, aún sabiendo que él es quien me mataViendo en mi avatar erratas y ratas ingratas que atacanO acatas la fama o te atrapa y acabas a gatasMás manchas que un dálmata en mi alma, pero aún presumoEl mundo busca héroes, pero no soy unoSólo asumo mi levedad y mi ignoranciaNo hay más verdad que la felicidad que da la infanciaY no sé si es la edad o una hemorragia, pero me falta magiaCada vez menos euforia y más nostalgiaCada vez más pesar y menos eficaciaCada vez menos al bar y más a la farmaciaAhora sé que la arrogancia es frágil y vencerla es fácilQue el temor es ágil y mi carne un muffin que se despedazaY por si el azar me caza, me quedo en casa escribiendoYa no hay tiempo de bajar a fumar a la plazaPrefiero ser un apátrida en mi Atlándida perdidaDonde las letras más gélidas me abriganY más que por mis niggas, lo hago por mis amigasPor no quedarme con la intriga de lo que diránUnos tragarán saliva, otros dudandoArtista al que el arte de vivir le cuesta tantoLa belleza me acaricia pero cae volandoY el dolor se clava y cada clavo hay que arrancarloVislumbrando mi horizonte donde antes vi montesHoy hay rinocerontes embistiendo a golpesCada corte aquí es como un tour por Invernalia(Y..) Tras ocho discos más hambriento que SomaliaDa igual la indumentaria  cuenta lo de abajoPero ver tras la piel eso sí que nos cuesta trabajoHay un atajo a un universo sin cerrojosDe prados con versos pa'l que mira por mis ojos, yoSólo soy un piojo en esta inmensidad pero me arrojoA este Mar Rojo que es la adversidadY a veces la venzo y a veces me venceLa lucha de cualquier hombre decente en una gran ciudadUrbanología, disciplina y corazón en este enjambreOtra versión de los Juegos del HambreOtra lección para que niños se hagan grandesOtra prisión de la que planeo escaparme, y¿Cómo aceptarme si soy tan complejo?Si me atrae más la ventana que el espejoSi soy más conejo que coyote en este bosqueYo soy de los que saben moverse sin venderse a bajo costeUn día aposté, ése fue el génesis, tumor de MC'sEl boca a boca se encargó de la metástasisLo hago por quien pierda o quien se retrasePor quien se sienta siempre en la última fila de clasePablo y Baghira traen la base, yo le pongo el toppingEscribo y hago que mi boli baile poppingKnockin' on the heaven's door pero nadie abreEl infierno quizás abra, porque mis palabras arden¿Quién vence a la desgana en este melodrama?Si el miedo te llama a los pies de la camaPor eso corre y ama a quien te dé la ganaQué más da si nos vamos a morir mañanaSubí mi persiana y cerré mi heridaCambié de perspectiva y desde entonces no hay misterioHoy la cosa que me tomo más en serio en esta vidaEs a no tomar la vida demasiado en serio"

Eleven anclas, icen velasNo hay bandera blanca; sables, calaveraAh, una mano en el timónY una botella de ron sobre el suelo de maderaY el tesoro que yo quiero no es el cobreSólo el oro de aquellos a quienes sobrePorque a pesar de todo somos hombres honradosNo tocamos a mujeres ni robamos a los pobresNoches frías como el acero forjadoBajo cero y el ambiente enrarecidoLa sangre me ha dejado los dedos manchadosEstoy enganchado a esta vida de forajido[Estribillo: Natos]Porque la vida pirata es la vida mejorAlrededor del mundo sin un rumbo definidoNi brújula ni mapa del tesoro perdidoSale humo del cañónLa vida pirata es la vida mejorAlrededor del mundo sin un rumbo definidoNi brújula ni mapa del tesoro perdidoSólo cicatrices en el corazón[Verso 2: Waor]La ciudad duerme, se encienden las velasAl ver el mover de sus caderasBotellas y lunas llenasA la deriva la noche enteraDormir a deshora, beber más de la cuentaAntecedentes, doblar la apuestaEscupir al mundo, romper las reglasEl cristal del zapato de la CenicientaCantos de sirenas, monedas de plataEcharle huevos o echar por patasLlenar las arcas y tirar pa' casaHago estallar el mueblebar del Palace, somos piratasToa' la vida contra viento y mareaNo me creo nada que mis ojos no veanFumando, mirando el barrio desde la azoteaPensando si saltar o quedarme pa' darles ceraViento en popa a toda velaMi patria son mis hermanos, mi parque, mi aceraFuiste la calma que precedió a la tormentaComo el que se santigua sabiendo que va a la guerra"
