# 5. Python & Jupyter

#### 5.1. Installing python

```bash
brew install python3
````

#### 5.2. Installing pip

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade --user pip
```
#### 5.3. Upgrading pip: warning message
Previous command might print a warning message to upgrade your pip version. Something like "You should consider upgrading via...". Use the command that is printed on your terminal. In my case, it is:
```bash
usr/local/opt/python@3.9/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### 5.4. Installing jupyter

```bash
sudo python3 -m pip install jupyter
```
