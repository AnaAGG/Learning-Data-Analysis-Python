# 1. Installing Homebrew

1. Open your **Terminal** app on Mac.

3. Go to this site: https://brew.sh and copy the line code below the "install homebrew" title. You should see something like:

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

    depending on your MacOS version, you might see a different snippet of code. Make sure you use the one the website provides you.

3. Paste into your terminal and run it.

4. Then, type the following command, just to make sure it is up-to-date (although most likely brew will update itself).

    ```bash
    brew update
    ```
