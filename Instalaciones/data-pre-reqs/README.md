In this repository, you will find the ultimate guide to be ready for the data analytics bootcamp at Ironhack (Madrid edition).

This is for **MacOS** users only.

## Installation goals
- Brew, git, VSC, iTerm2, jupyter notebook, conda, mongodb, MySQL & workbench.

## Skills goals
You will do the following tasks at least once.
- Navigating through **terminal**
- Edit files in **Visual Studio Code**
- **Git**: git add, git commit & git push.
- **Github**: fork, clone & pull request.
- **Scripting**: bash & python.
- **MySQL**: import and queries
- **MongoDB**: import and queries

If you follow the instructions here:
1. You will have your machine completely ready for coding
2. You will have practiced, at least once, the daily tasks you will carry out throughout the course.

Follow these steps to get on board the rocket ship ðŸš€

#### 1. Follow the installation guides for every program/coding environment

If you did your prework, some of the things you will already have set up. However, read carefully not to miss anything extra (and valuable) that you can find here.

#### 2. After installing each program, there might be an exercise:


a) to check that it does work
b) for you to become familiar with it

This way, your first day at Ironhack will not be your first time doing this. Trust me, your future self will be very grateful.
