# 3. Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is an IDE (integrated development environment) that we will use to develop our projects. It mainly serves as a text editor.


##### 1. Installation
To install it, we can it do it in two ways: we can either open our browser and go to the VSC website and manually download it or we can user brew. Since we're learning we'll do it by running this on our terminal:

```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```
If you look through your apps on your Mac, you'll see it is now installed. 

##### 2. Extensions and configuration

Open VSC. Press the keys: `cmmd + shift + p`.
A menu will appear on the top. We will use this for two things. After you pressed the keys, write the following text and click on it to install:
- Shell command: install 'code' command in PATH
- Python: select interpreter

Sometimes the shell command is not available. Do not worry, we will cover it later. 

Lastly, on the lower-left corner, you'll see an icon where you can log in. Maybe you want to connect it to your github account so that your configuration is synced for future installations & so you can manage future git extensions.
