# 9. Miscellaneous
### Extra

##### Tree
Tree will show you the worktree of files you have in a given location. Very useful!
```bash
brew install tree
```

##### Tableau
```bash
brew install --cask tableau
```
##### Spectacle
This, of course, is completely optional, but is very useful when you need to have your Terminal side to side to your VSC: https://www.spectacleapp.com

You can either download it from their website or run this command in your terminal:
```bash
brew install --cask spectacle
```
##### Geopandas

```bash
brew install gdal
xcode-select --install
pip3 install --upgrade setuptools

#Create a environment for geopandas
conda create --name maps
conda activate maps
pip install geopandas
```
