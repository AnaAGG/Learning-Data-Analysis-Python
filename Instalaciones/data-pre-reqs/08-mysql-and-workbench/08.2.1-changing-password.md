# I want to change the password

If for whatever reason you had some issues with your password, you can follow these steps to reset it:

Stop and start MySQL:
```bash
killall mysqld mysqld_safe
mysql.server start
sudo mysql -u root -p #Use admin as your password
```
Then, one by one:

```bash
USE mysql;
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY "YourNewPasswordGoesHerePleaseReplaceIt";
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
QUIT;
```
