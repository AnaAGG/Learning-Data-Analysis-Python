# 2- Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is an IDE (integrated development environment) that we will use to develop our projects. It mainly serves as a text editor.

**2.1. Installation**
To install we should open our browser and go to the VSC [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  

                    ❗ We download for Windows ❗
                         
⚠ In the installation process they will ask us if we want to install it on the way. We select that box ⚠
